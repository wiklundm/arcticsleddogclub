# ARCTIC SLEDDOG CLUB

# Introduction

## Welcome to the website of Arctic Sleddog Club

![Sleddogteams runs on a snowy mountain](assets/images/sleddogteam.jpg)

The Arctic Sleddog Club is a club located in the far north of Sweden in a town called Abisko.
There are more than 4000 dogs in the area and sleddog tourism is a big source of income. Despite that there are no training or educational facilities. When the season starts most kennels and companies have to teach and train their employees by them selves for several weeks before they can start working with the tourists. This is both expensive and timeconsuming. For the natives who wants to know more about sleddogs the closest club and training facility are in Kiruna approximately 250km away.

The weather can rapidly change in the mountains and it can be dangerous if you are not prepared for the arctic climate. The temperature falls below -40 degrees Celsius some weeks over the year and lavins are frequently occurring. The club wants to spread the knowledge about how to enjoy dogsledding in the mouintanins while still being safe.
Since the winter is long and cold and which guarantees enough snow on the trails, and the high amount of sleddogs in the area, makes the location for the club optimal.

*The Arctic Sleddog Clubs purpose is to educate and spread the knowledge about sleddog culture and to engage people in outdoor activities in an arctic environment.
*To educate train for and participate in sleddog races.
*To promote good dogcare and sportsmanship and work against doping and discrimination in sports.

*The website is a three-page website. It features an home page, a courses page and an about us page, where you can read about when, where and what the next course is about and it has a contact form.

_Please note that this site is a fictional website using HTML and CSS and was created for The Code Institutes Milestone Project 1. There are no Arctic Sleddog Club even though there are demands for it._

# UX

## Development Plane

### Strategy Plan

The site is fictional.
Research was made online and by interviews of members from different sleddog associations.
I discovered that people living and visiting the area mainly did so due to its beautiful nature, and sleddog tourism is a big source of income.
Research also told me that there are almost as many sleddogs as people in the county of Kiruna.
The nature is free for everyone to visit, but there are regulations you need to follow in the mountain area, especially when comes to areas with reindeers.
The arctid climate and remote location with with frequent lavins makes it important to have the right knowledge before driving sleddogs in the area.

#### User goals

- The site targets young people and adults with an interest in sleddogs and nature.
- Living or spending time during the winter in the area.
- To spread the knowledge about sleddogs and its culture and how to behave in the mountains in an arctic climate.
- To educate and train for sleddog competitions.

#### First time user

- To create a professional design that are not causing information overload. When I did research I found out that many websites of sleddog clubs was cropped with information and had flawed layout.
- To make a user easily navigate between the pages and attract with both text and visual images.
- To find information about the content, location, time and price of the upcoming course.
- Give access to social media links for reviews and other information.
- To have a contact form where the user can ask questions and apply for the next course.
- To give the user short information about the clubs policy and regulations needed to know.

#### Returning user and first-time user

- As both a returning and first-time visitor I want to easily be able to contact the Sleddog Club.
- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.
- To easily find information about the next course.

#### Business goals

The website is mainly for individuals but when information spreads, the understanding and knowledge of the sport and sleddog culture increases which gives positive effects also on companies specialized in sleddogs and tourism.

- Increased interest in the sport can give the business more customers.
- The companies specialized in tourism can hire educated staff instead of putting several weeks on training new staff by themselves as it right now.
- When people following the rules in the mountains, the reindeers gest less stressed and the Sami people are getting healthier animals with higher survival rate which increases their income. A good relation with the natives makes the club able to use their land for the clubs purposes.
- Income from advertising and sponsorship on competitions and business events.

### Other considerations

#### The Arctic Sleddog Club has a B2C (Business-to-costumer) approach

- The design stands out amongst the competitors.
- Minimal content and large images to avoid informational overload as in many similar websites.
- The content and headlines are appealing and fills a purpose..
- There is a lot of sleddogs in the area but no training facilities or clubs.

# DESIGN PROCESS

1.**Strategy plane**

I wanted to create a page that could gather people with similar interests and spread knowledge about sleddogs. The website should be easy to use, to navigate and find the information the user have come for. I had recently started to learn how to write code and my aim for this project was to apply what I had learned in HTML and CSS.

2.**Scope plan**

*I decided that since the nature and dogs is the main reason people would visit the page it is important to have images visualizing the experiences the people joining the club and attending the course would have. To provide enough information so the user wants to know more.
*I needed a contact form.
*Location, meeting hours and costs for the course.
*Information about what to expect taking the course.
*Information about the club.

*Functionality requirements:
The user needs to be able to navigate through the website to access all the contents.
The user can easily contact the club.

3.**Structure plane**

When I had decided what features I wanted, I began to create the structure of my design into pages.
The website has three pages and the links on the navigation bar opens in a new tab.

There is a navigation menu bar to easily navigate between the pages that encourages the user to stay motivated and continue to the next step. The navigation bar is responsive with links to the different pages and for smaller screens there are a hamburger icon with a dropdown list to save space. When users hover over the Home, About us or Contact navigation links with their cursor the subsequent link will become underlinded. This makes the site more interactive for the user.
![Screenshot of two different sizes of the navigation bar](assets/docs/nav-bar.jpg)

#### HOME Page

*The Home tells the user they are visiting a website for a Sleddog club.
*That the club is located in a mountain area with beautiful and relaxing environments.
*Provides contact information.
*An inspirational text gives a mental picture of what you can experience.

#### COURSES Page

*The Courses page tells the user when, where, the price and content of the next course.
*There are additional information good to know when visiting and joining the club.
*There are an inspirational youtube-video that combines audio and video to inform about the sport.

#### ABOUT US Page

*The About us page tells the user a little about the club and what regulations need to be followed.
*There are a contact section with input fields for name, adress, email and an information field, where the user can leave a message to the club.

My Favicon was created using RedKetchup. I created the Faviocon from a picture of one of my own sleddogs. ![Screenshot of my Favicon](assets/docs/favicon.jpg)

##### Colours

 I used Hexcolorpedia <https://hexcolorpedia.com/> and Ginifab <https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/color_picker_from_image.sv.php> to identify colours from the sleddogteam-image and used them as the base for the rest of the colours.
 I chosed soft colours that suited that colour scheme.
As a background colour in case the images does not load I chose #lightblue.

# Issues and bugs

**Issue**
The biggest issue was internet disruption and that Codeanywhere often stopped working, had to be reloaded and data not being pushed. This was frustrating and very timeconsuming and sometimes some parts of the code went missing. This problem was unfortunately nothing I could fix, just try to work around it and push more often.

My Codeanywhere account was suddenly stopped. I recieved a new account from CodeInstitute. When the staff was transfering project from the old workspace to the new one something went wrong and I could not code. They had to debug. This took a few days. I found the solution on stack.

**Issue**
From the beginning I put the img url and src in the css file for the hero image. The validator did not accept this. When I changed the code to index.html instead unfortunately the covertext was not responsive anymore.
Solution: The heroimage was set to position: relative with a width and height of 100% and the covertext to position absolute and fixed width and adjusted by padding.

**Issue**
When moving the hero image from css to index.html i had got a new white line under the image.
No matter what I tried I could not fix the problem. When I had a meeting with my mentor I asked for help and after a lot of testing we still could not make it disappear. The solution was setting the margin to -10%.

**Issue**
Css warning: Importent statement - do not load in parallel @import google fonts.
Solution: after reading all I could find on stack and talking to my mentor we decided to ignore the issue since it did not made any real problem.

# Deployment

To make my project viewable to others.
The project was developed in Codeanywhere, commited to Git and pushed and stored to GitHub pages. This allowed me to share the live website with others.

- Go to the repositorys main page.
- In the top of the main page of the repository, locate the menu and click on the settings button.
- On the left side of the page is a list. Under "code and automation" locate the Pages tab and click it.
- Set the source to Deploy from branch.
- Choose main branch and set the folder to root. Click Save.
- Refresh the page. Wait a few minutes for the page to be build. Refresh if nescessary.
- On the right side under Environments 1 click github pages.
- Click on view deployment to open the url. <https://wiklundm.github.io/arcticsleddogclub/>

## Clone the repository

By cloning a GitHub repository you can create a local copy of your remote repository on your computer. By doing so you can make changes or view the repository without affecting the original repository.

- Log in to GitHub
- Go to the repository you want to clone.
- Above the list of files click the button called Code
- Click on the tab called Local
- Chose if you want to use HTTPS or SSH key.
- Copy the URL link
- Open a new terminal on your IDE
- Change the location of the working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be.
- Type git clone and paste the URL you just copied.
- Press Enter and a local clone will be created.
  
# Testing

W3C Css and HTML validatorservice was used throughout the project to check whether there were any errors in my code.
I manualy tested the project on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari browsers. This did not lead to any problems.
I used a mobile first approach. I continued to test the responsiveness throughout the development process. I used Google Chromes Dev Tools to view the result on different screen sizes. By doing so I adjusted margins, paddings and image sizes to fit different screen sizes.

Menu bar: Clicking on the Logo or Home link returns the user to the Home page. Clicking on the Courses link takes the user to the Courses page. Clicking on the About us link directs the user to the About us page.

Footer: Clicking on the Facebook icon takes the user to the Facebook page. Clicking on Instagram takes the user to Instagram page
Clicking on Twitter takes the user to Twitter page.

Form: I manually tested that the form requested input data in name fields and an email adress in email-field and that you could not continue without filling in the data requested. I tested that the contact us button was responding by sending me to the test template page when I clicked the button.
