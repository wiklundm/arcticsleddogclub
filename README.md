Arctic Sleddog Club

Introduction
Welcome to the website of Arctic Sleddog Club!
The Arctic Sleddog Club is a club located in the far north of Sweden in a town called Abisko
There are more than 4000 dogs in the area and sleddog tourism is a big source of income. Despite that there are no training or educational facilities. When the season starts most kennels and companies have to teach and train their employees by them selves for several weeks before they can start working with the tourists. This is both expensive and timeconsuming. For the natives who wants to know more about sleddogs the closest club and training facility are in Kiruna approximately 250km away.

The Arctic Sleddog Club is seated at the mountains in beautiful surroundings, but even though the nature is beautiful the weather can rapidly change, and it can be dangerous if you are not prepared for the arctic climate. The temperature falls below -40 degrees Celsius some weeks of the year and lavins are frequently occurring. Since its amount of snow during the year the winter season is long, and the club can guarantee that there is sufficient amount of snow on the trails. The club wants to spread the knowledge about how to enjoy dogsledding in the mouintanins while still being safe.  

With this said the Arctic Sleddog Clubs purpose is to educate and spread the knowledge about sleddog culture and to engage people in outdoor activities in an arctic environment. To educate train for and participate in sleddog races. To promote a good dogcare and sportsmanship and work against doping and discrimination in sports.
The website is a three-page website. It features an home page, a courses page and an about page where you can read about when, where and what the next course is about.

Please note that this site is a fictional website using HTML and CSS and was created for The Code Institutes Milestone Project 1. There are no Arctic Sleddog Club even though there are demands for it.

UX
Development Plane

1. Strategy Plan
Thes site is fictional.
Online research was and interviewed members of different sleddog associations in the county of Norrbotten (the biggest county by area in Sweden).
I discovered that people living and visiting the area mainly did so due to its beautiful nature, and sleddog tourism was a big part of why people went there.
Research also told me that there are almost as many sleddogs as people in the county of Kiruna.
The nature is free for everyone to visit but there are a few regulations that needs to be followed in the mountain area, especially when comes to areas with reindeers.

User goals

* The site targets young and adults with an interest in sleddogs and nature.
* Living fulltime or winter season in the area in the north of the county of Kiruna.
* To spread the knowledge about sleddogs and its culture and how to behave in the mountains in an arctic climate.

First time user

* Create a design that was professional and not causing information overload. There were many websites that was cropped with information and very poor layout.
* To make a user easily navigate between the pages and attract with both text and visual images.
* To find information about the content, location and time of the upcoming course.
* Give access to social media links for reviews and other information.

Returning user and first-time user

* As both a returning and first-time visitor I want to find options to contact the Sleddog Club.
* To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

Business goals
The website is mainly for individuals but when the knowledge of the sports and dogcare increases, the understanding and knowledge of the sport and sleddog culture increases which gives positive effects also on businesses.

* Increased interest in the sport can give the business more customers.
* The business can hire educated staff instead of putting several weeks into training new staff by themselves as is for now.
* When people following the rules in the mountains, the reindeerâ€™s gest less stressed and the Sami are getting healthier animals.

Other considerations

*The Arctic Sleddog Club has a B2C (Business-to-costumer) approach.

* The design stands out amongst the competitors.
* Minimal content and large images to avoid informational overload as in many similar websites.
* The content and headlines are appealing and fills a purpose.
* There is a slight difference between the Arctic Sleddog Club and other companies organizing courses since it is a club.

DESIGN PROCESS

1.Strategy plane
I wanted to create a page that could gather people with similar interests and spread knowledge about sleddogs.
I had recently started to learn how to write code and my aim for this project was to apply what I had learned in HTML and CSS.

2.Scope plan
I decided that since the nature and dogs is the main reason people would visit the page it is important to have images visualizing the experiences the people attending the course would have.
I needed a contact form.
Location and meeting hours.
Information about what to expect taking the course.

Functionality requirements:
The user needs to be able to navigate through the website to access all the contents.
The user can easily contact the club.

3.Structure plane
When I had decided what features I wanted, I began to create the structure of my design into pages.
The Home page would tell the user what they are visiting a site for a Sleddog club. That the club is in a mountain area with beautiful and relaxing environments and contact information.
The Courses page tells the user when and where the next course will be, the main content and price for the cour
The About us page tells us a little of the club.
There is a navigation menu bar but also astrategically placed button to encourage the user to stay motivated and continue to the next step.

4.Skeleton plane
Wireframes were made in Balsamic to design the navigation and interface for desktop, tablet and mobile. The header and footer remain the same over the pages with functional icons and navigation.

5.Surface plane
The colors needed to match the colors in the sky and snow on the ground. Since the colors in the sky are varying with the time of day and light, I chose colors that suited that color scheme. I used Ginifab.com to identify colors from the image on home page and added other colors that fit well with the other ones from Hexcolorpedia .

Favicon
The Favicon was created from a picure of one of my own sleddogs using RedKetchup.

Fonts
I chose the fonts by testing different types on Google Fonts.
The main fonts used on the website and the logo is Lato light 300, a sans-serif font. I used a font called Philosopher, also a sans-serif, for the inspirational text on the Home page and the headings.
Images
The background image on the home page is borrowed from my friends private collection Anna Norman at Lifestyle North AB/Kiruna Dogsled AB.
The remaining pictures are from iStock free photos. The photos represent different parts of the sleddog sport and are motivational.

FEATURES
The Home Page:

The Header
The logo has the heading with the name of the club to easily understand what the site is all about.
The navigation bar includes links to the Home, Course and About us. The links helps the user to easily navigate to a specific content they are looking for without having to use the back button in the browser head or keep scrolling down to find the relevant content. The nav links have an active state which changes according to which section the user is currently looking at. On smaller screens the navbar is an burger-icon that toggles down and on larger screen the navigatin links are spread out evenly. The header remains in the same position and style over the website.

The landing page image
The image covers 100% of the viewport width. The main colours are light and gives a good contrast to the text. It is fully responsive.

Issues and bugs

The biggest issue was my bad internet connetion. The Codeanywehere often stopped working, had to be reloaded, data was not being pushed and meny times I did not know if it was the code that was wrong or the connection problem.This was frustrating and very timeconsuming since I hade to start over and over again meny times and made me unsurtain of my code. This problem was unfortunately nothing I could fix due to there are no better service here, just try to work around it and push more often.
The nest issue that made a lot of more issues stacking up was when my free codingtime on Codeanywhere was stopped. I got another free account from CodeInstitute. The problem was to transfer the project to the place. It seemed to work for a little time but when the old one stopped working I was not able to push or change anything in the new account either. This was also very timeconsuming and for days I could not code since we did not had any education on that part from the program.  I searched for solutions how to merge the accounts on stack.

Issue:
The flexbox properties for the contact page -section meeting would not align to the left on and the course content info would not align to the right.
Solution:

Issue:
Css warning: Importent statement do not load in parallel (@import google fonts).
Solution: after reading all I could find on stack and talking to my mentor we decided to ignore the issue since it did not made any real problem.

Deployment
To make my project viewable to others.
The project was developed in Codeanywhere, commited to Git and pushed and stored to GitHub pages. This allowed me to share the live website with others. <https://wiklundm.github.io/arcticsleddogclub/>

Testing
W3C Css and HTML validatorservice was used throughout the project to check whether there were any errors in my code.
I manualy tested the project on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari browsers. This did not lead to any problems.
I used a mobile first approach. I continued to test the responsiveness throughout the development process. I used Google Chromes Dev Tools to view the result on different screen sizes. By doing so I adjusted margins, paddings and image sizes to fit different screen sizes.

Menu bar: Clicking on the Logo or Home link returns the user to the Home page. Clicking on the Courses link takes the user to the Courses page. Clicking on the About us link directs the user to the About us page.

Footer: Clicking on the Facebook icon takes the user to the Facebook page. Clicking on Instagram takes the user to Instagram page
Clicking on Twitter takes the user to Twitter page.

Form: I manually tested that the form requested input data in name fields and an email adress in email-field and that you could not continue without filling in the data requested. I tested that the contact us button was responding by sending me to the test template page when I clicked the button.
