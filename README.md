# ARCTIC SLEDDOG CLUB

# Introduction

## Welcome to the website of Arctic Sleddog Club

The Arctic Sleddog Club is a club located in the far north of Sweden in a town called Abisko.
There are more than 4000 dogs in the area and sleddog tourism is a big source of income. Despite that there are no training or educational facilities. When the season starts most kennels and companies have to teach and train their employees by them selves for several weeks before they can start working with the tourists. This is both expensive and timeconsuming. For the natives who wants to know more about sleddogs the closest club and training facility are in Kiruna approximately 250km away.

The weather can rapidly change in the mountains and it can be dangerous if you are not prepared for the arctic climate. The temperature falls below -40 degrees Celsius some weeks over the year and lavins are frequently occurring. The club wants to spread the knowledge about how to enjoy dogsledding in the mouintanins while still being safe. 
The winter is long and cold with a guarantee of enough snow on the trails and the amount of sleddogs in the area makes the location for the club optimal. 

*The Arctic Sleddog Clubs purpose is to educate and spread the knowledge about sleddog culture and to engage people in outdoor activities in an arctic environment.
*To educate train for and participate in sleddog races.
*To promote good dogcare and sportsmanship and work against doping and discrimination in sports.
*The website is a three-page website. It features an home page, a courses page and an about us page, where you can read about when, where and what the next course is about and it has a contact form.

_Please note that this site is a fictional website using HTML and CSS and was created for The Code Institutes Milestone Project 1. There are no Arctic Sleddog Club even though there are demands for it._

# UX

## Development Plane

### Strategy Plan

The site is fictional.
Research was made online and by interviews of members from different sleddog associations.
I discovered that people living and visiting the area mainly did so due to its beautiful nature, and sleddog tourism is a big source of income.
Research also told me that there are almost as many sleddogs as people in the county of Kiruna.
The nature is free for everyone to visit, but there are regulations you need to follow in the mountain area, especially when comes to areas with reindeers.
The arctid climate and remote location with with frequent lavins makes it important to have the right knowledge before driving sleddogs in the area.

#### User goals

- The site targets young people and adults with an interest in sleddogs and nature.
- Living or spending time during the winter in the area.
- To spread the knowledge about sleddogs and its culture and how to behave in the mountains in an arctic climate.

#### First time user

- Create a professional design that are not causing information overload. When I did research I found out that many websites of sleddog clubs  was cropped with information and had flawed layout.
- To make a user easily navigate between the pages and attract with both text and visual images.
- To find information about the content, location, time and price of the upcoming course.
- Give access to social media links for reviews and other information.

#### Returning user and first-time user

- As both a returning and first-time visitor I want to easily be able to contact the Sleddog Club.
- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

#### Business goals

The website is mainly for individuals but when information aspreads, the understanding and knowledge of the sport and sleddog culture increases which gives positive effects also on businesses.

- Increased interest in the sport can give the business more customers.
- The business can hire educated staff instead of putting several weeks into training new staff by themselves as is for now.
- When people following the rules in the mountains, the reindeers gest less stressed and the Sami are getting healthier animals with higher survival rate. This gives a good relation with the natives and makes the club able to use their land for the clubs purposes.
- Advertising, sponsorship on competitions and businessevents also gives profits.
- The tourism companies can hire educated staff which saves several weeks of time and money.
  
### Other considerations

#### The Arctic Sleddog Club has a B2C (Business-to-costumer) approach

- The design stands out amongst the competitors.
- Minimal content and large images to avoid informational overload as in many similar websites.
- The content and headlines are appealing and fills a purpose.
- There are no other clubs in the area but a lot of sleddogs.

# DESIGN PROCESS

1.**Strategy plane**

I wanted to create a page that could gather people with similar interests and spread knowledge about sleddogs. The user should be easy to use, navigate and find the information the user have come for. I had recently started to learn how to write code and my aim for this project was to apply what I had learned in HTML and CSS.

2.**Scope plan**

-I decided that since the nature and dogs is the main reason people would visit the page it is important to have images visualizing the experiences the people joining the club and attending the course would have. To provide enough information so the user wants to know more.
-I needed a contact form.
-Location, meeting hours and costs for the course.
-Information about what to expect taking the course.
-Information about the club.

*Functionality requirements:
The user needs to be able to navigate through the website to access all the contents.
The user can easily contact the club.

3.**Structure plane**

When I had decided what features I wanted, I began to create the structure of my design into pages.
The website has three pages and the links on the navigation bar opens in a new tab.

-The **Home** page would tell the user they are visiting a site for a Sleddog club.
That the club is in a mountain area with beautiful and relaxing environments and provide contact information.
An inspirational text gives a mental picture of what you can experience.

-The **Courses** page tells the user when, where, the price and content of the next course.

-The **About us** page tells the user a little about the club and what regulations need to be followed.
There are a contact section with input fields for name, adress, email and an information field where the user can leave a message to the club.

There is a navigation menu bar to easily navigate between the pages that encourages the user to stay motivated and continue to the next step.
The navigation bar is responsive with links to the different pages and for smaller screens there are a hamburger icon with a dropdown list to save space. When users hover over the Home, About us or Contact navigation links with their cursor the subsequent link will become underlinded. This makes the site mor interactive for the user. ![Screenshot of two different sizes of the navigation bar](assets/docs/navigation-bar.jpg)

4.**Skeleton plane**

**Balsamic** to create the wireframes during the design process. The Balsamic are a very basic model of how I was planning the layout to turn out and worked as a reminder for the structure in different screensizes.![Screenshot of Balsamic Wireframe I used](assets/docs/wireframe-tiny.jpg)

5.**Surface plane**

## Technologies used

**Language** HTML5 and CSS3

**Workspace** *Codeanywhere to write the code

**GitHub** to store the project and Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub

**FontAwesome** to import icons for UX purposes and to look good. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Paws, Calender. The fonts are used in the footer and in the unordered lists. The fonts in the footer has links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and redirects the user to that webpage destination in a new tab.

**Am I Responsive** to preview the website on different screensizes.![Screenshot of Am I Responsive](assets/docs/am-i-responsive.jpg)

**Favicon** was created using RedKetchup with a picture of one of my own sleddogs. ![Screenshot of my Favicon](assets/docs/favicon.jpg)

**Colours**
 I used Hexcolorpedia and Ginifab.com to identify colours from the image on home page and used them as the base for the rest of the colours. I chose soft colours that suited that color scheme.
As a background colour in case the images does not load I chose #lightblue. I used a light blue rgb(132,172,222 0.2) and light pink rgb(220,173,170 0,2) .![Screenshot of colours I used](assets/docs/colours.jpg).

**Fonts**
I chose the fonts by testing different types on Google Fonts.
The main fonts used on the website and the logo is Lato light 300, a sans-serif font. I used a font called Philosopher, also a sans-serif, for the inspirational text on the Home page and the headings. For the headings and paragraphs I used the dark colour #3a3a3a. For the header and footer i used the light #ffffff for high contrast.

**Images**
Tiny-Png and Shopify was used to resize and compress the images.

The background image on the home page is borrowed from my friends private collection Anna Norman at Lifestyle North AB/Kiruna Dogsled AB. The other pictures are from IStock and are free pictures to use.
The images represents different parts of the sleddog sport and are motivational.
The images are displayed under the section of the website they belong.

I also added a YouTube sleddog movie made by National Geographic to add both sound and visual effects and give the user a teaser and more information about the sport.

On smaller screens the navbar is an burger-icon that toggles down and on larger screen the navigatin links are spread out evenly. The header remme position and style over the website. The lesson from I love Running helped me create the burger icon.

## Issues and bugs

Issue
The biggest issue was my bad internet connetion. The Codeanywehere often stopped working, had to be reloaded and data was not being pushed many times and it was hard to keep track on what parts that went missing. This was frustrating and very timeconsuming. This problem was unfortunately nothing I could fix due to there are no better service here, just try to work around it and push more often. 

My free coding hours on Codeanywhere was stopped. I recieved a new account from CodeInstitute. The problem was when the project was transfer from the old workspace to the new one. Something went wrong when they did the transfer and they had to debug. This took a few days. I found the solution on stack. When my work was almost done I got an email that the Codeanywhere should be stopped due tue maintenance and release of a new version the day before and the day of my exam. The timing was just not great.

Issue:
At first I hade put the image url in css and the src for the hero image on the Home page. When I run the validator it did not accept that so I moved it to the index.html insted. Unfortunately the covertext was then not responsive anymore.  Solution: The heroimage was set to position: relative with a width and height of 100% and the covertext to position absolute and fixed width and adjusted by padding. 

Issue:
When moving the hero image from css to index.html i had a problem with a white line under the image. No matter what I tried I could not fix the problem. When I had a meeting with my mentor I asked for help and after a lot of testing we still could not make it disappear. The solution was setting the margin to -10%. 

Issue:

Issue:
Css warning: Importent statement do not load in parallel (@import google fonts).
Solution: after reading all I could find on stack and talking to my mentor we decided to ignore the issue since it did not made any real problem.

# Deployment

To make my project viewable to others.
The project was developed in Codeanywhere, commited to Git and pushed and stored to GitHub pages. This allowed me to share the live website with others. <https://wiklundm.github.io/arcticsleddogclub/>

Testing
W3C Css and HTML validatorservice was used throughout the project to check whether there were any errors in my code.
I manualy tested the project on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari browsers. This did not lead to any problems.
I used a mobile first approach. I continued to test the responsiveness throughout the development process. I used Google Chromes Dev Tools to view the result on different screen sizes. By doing so I adjusted margins, paddings and image sizes to fit different screen sizes.

Menu bar: Clicking on the Logo or Home link returns the user to the Home page. Clicking on the Courses link takes the user to the Courses page. Clicking on the About us link directs the user to the About us page.

Footer: Clicking on the Facebook icon takes the user to the Facebook page. Clicking on Instagram takes the user to Instagram page
Clicking on Twitter takes the user to Twitter page.

Form: I manually tested that the form requested input data in name fields and an email adress in email-field and that you could not continue without filling in the data requested. I tested that the contact us button was responding by sending me to the test template page when I clicked the button.
