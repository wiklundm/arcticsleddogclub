Arctic Sleddog Club


Introduction
Welcome to the website of Arctic Sleddog Club!

The Arctic Sleddog Club is a club located in the far north of Sweden in a town called Abisko 68°20?58?N 18°49?53?Ö. 
There are more than 4000 dogs in the area and sleddog tourism is a big source of income. Despite that there are no training or educational facilities. The closest one is outside Kiruna approximately 250km away. 
The Arctic Sleddog Club is seated at the bottom of the mountains in beautiful surroundings, but even though the nature is beautiful the weather can rapidly change, and it can be dangerous if you don’t know how to behave in different situations in the arctic climate. The temperature falls below -40 degrees Celsius and some parts of the year and lavin’s are frequently occurring. Since its amount of snow during the year the training season is long, and the club can guarantee that there is sufficient amount of snow on the trails.
 
With this said the Arctic Sleddog Clubs purpose is to educate and spread the knowledge about sleddog culture and to engage people in outdoor activities in an arctic environment. To educate train for and participate in sleddog races. To promote a good dogcare and sportsmanship and work against doping and discrimination in sports.
The website is a three-page website. It features an about page and a courses page where you can read about when, where and what the next course is about. 


Please note that this site is fictional website using HTML and CSS was created for The Code Institutes Milestone Project 1. There are no Arctic Sleddog Club even though there are demands for it. 

UX
Development Plane

1. Strategy Plan
Thes site is fictional. 
Online research was and interviewed members of different sleddog associations in the county of Norrbotten (the biggest county by area in Sweden). 
I discovered that people living and visiting the area mainly did so due to its beautiful nature, and sleddog tourism was a big part of why people went there. 
Research also told me that there are almost as many sleddogs as people in the county of Kiruna. 
The nature is free for everyone to visit but there are a few regulations that needs to be followed in the mountain area, especially when comes to areas with reindeers.

User goals
* The site targets young and adults with an interest in sleddogs and nature. 
* Living fulltime or winter season in the area in the north of the county of Kiruna.
* To spread the knowledge about sleddogs and its culture and how to behave in the mountains in an arctic climate.

First time user
* Create a design that was professional and not causing information overload. There were many websites that was cropped with information and very poor layout.

* To make a user easily navigate between the pages and attract with both text and visual images.

* To find information about the content, location and time of the upcoming course.

* Give access to social media links for reviews and other information. 

Returning user and first-time user
* As both a returning and first-time visitor I want to find options to contact the Sleddog Club.

* To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

Business goals
The website is mainly for individuals but when the knowledge of the sports and dogcare increases, the understanding and knowledge of the sport and sleddog culture increases which gives positive effects also on businesses.
* Increased interest in the sport can give the business more customers.
* The business can hire educated staff instead of putting several weeks into training new staff by themselves as is for now.
* When people following the rules in the mountains, the reindeer’s gest less stressed and the Sami are getting healthier animals. 

Other considerations
The Arctic Sleddog Club has a B2C (Business-to-costumer) approach. 
* The design stands out amongst the competitors.
* Minimal content and large images to avoid informational overload as in many similar websites.
* The content and headlines are appealing and fills a purpose.
* There is a slight difference between the Arctic Sleddog Club and other companies organizing courses since it is a club. 

DESIGN PROCESS
* Strategy plane
I wanted to create a page that could gather people with similar interests and spread knowledge about sleddogs. 
I had recently started to learn how to write code and my aim for this project was to apply what I had learned in HTML and CSS. 

* Scope plane
I decided that since the nature and dogs is the main reason people would visit the page it is important to have images visualizing the experiences the people attending the course would have. 
I needed a contact form. 
Location and meeting hours.
Information about what to expect taking the course.

Functionality requirements:
The user needs to be able to navigate through the website to access all the contents.
The user can easily contact the club.

* Structure plane
When I had decided what features I wanted, I began to create the structure of my design into pages. 
The Home page would tell the user what they are visiting a site for a Sleddog club. That the club is in a mountain area with beautiful and relaxing environments.
The Courses page tells the user when and where the next course will be, the main content and prize for the course. There are links if you want to know more about regulations and federations.
The About us page tells us a little of the clubs’ purpose and there is contact information. 
There is a navigation menu bar but also strategically placed buttons to encourage the user to stay motivated and continue to the next step. 

* Skeleton plane
Wireframes were made in Balsamic to design the navigation and interface for desktop, tablet and mobile. The header and footer remain the same over the pages with functional icons and navigation.

* Surface plane
The colors needed to match the colors in the sky and snow on the ground. Since the colors in the sky are varying with the time of day and light, I chose colors that suited that color scheme. I used Ginifab.com to identify colors from the image on home page and added two other colors that fit well with the other ones. 

Fonts
I chose the fonts by testing different types on Google Fonts.
The main fonts used on the website and the logo is Lato light 300. I used a font called Philosopher for the inspirational text on the Home page.
Images
The image for the Home page and image called tent are borrowed from my friends private collection Anna Norman at Lifestyle North AB/Kiruna Dogsled AB. 
The remaining pictures are from iStock free photos. The photos represent different parts of the sleddog sport and gives a happy feeling.

Features

The Header
The logo has the heading with the name of the club to easily understand what the site is all about. 
The navigation bar includes links to the Home, Courses, About us and Contact area. The links helps the user to easily navigate to a specific content they are looking for without having to use the back button in the browser head or keep scrolling down to find the relevant content. The nav links have an active state which changes according to which section the user is currently looking at. 

The landing page image
Shows an image that shows what the site is all about and that the club is in a mountain area with beautiful and relaxing environment. The text inspires people to imagine that relaxing feeling and to want to experience driving a dogteam to make them interested in participate in the club.
